Linear Regression Model for Employee Salary Prediction
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict employee annual salaries based on demographic and job-related features. The project is implemented in Python using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

📊 Dataset
Source: boss.xlsx (included in the repository)

Description: Contains 141 employee records with features such as Employee ID, Full Name, Job Title, Department, Gender, Ethnicity, Age, Hire Date, Annual Salary, Bonus %, Country, City, and Exit Date.

🚀 Features
Data loading and preprocessing using pandas

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with seaborn and matplotlib

Feature selection and engineering

Linear regression model training and evaluation

Visualization of results

🛠️ Installation & Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn openpyxl
Open the notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook ML-model-on-linear-regression-1.ipynb
Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

📈 Results
The notebook walks through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model building, and evaluation.

Visualizations help understand feature relationships and salary trends.

The final model predicts annual salary based on selected features.
